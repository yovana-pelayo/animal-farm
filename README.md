## Getting Started

Use [this template](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/half-baked-web-01-animal-farm) to get started.

### Learning Objectives

-   Render a list of items with a link to a detail page (list / detail pattern)
-   Use URLSearchParams to get additional data about a web page
-   Use a function to filter an item from a list of data using an identifier

### Description

For this deliverable, you have been given a working app that shows a list of animals on the Alchemy Farm. You have just been asked to make each item link to a detail page that displays the information about each animal. This page should be at `/animals` and individual animals should be identified by using URLSearchParams.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   Each animal links to a page with their id in a URL search param such as `/animals/?id=1`
-   The `/animals` page shows the details of the animal
-   Should use a `findById` function to get the correct animal to display on `/animals`
